# ðŸš€ Deploy Espen D6 MCP Server to Railway

## Why Railway?
- âœ… **Free tier available**
- âœ… **5-minute setup**
- âœ… **Automatic HTTPS**
- âœ… **Environment variables**
- âœ… **Logs and monitoring**

## Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Verify your account

## Step 2: Deploy Your MCP Server

### Option A: From GitHub (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub repository
2. In Railway, click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `espen-d6-mcp-server` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy

### Option B: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
D6_PRODUCTION_MODE=true
D6_API_BASE_URL=https://integrate.d6plus.co.za/api/v2
D6_API_USERNAME=espenaitestapi
D6_API_PASSWORD=qUz3mPcRsfSWxKR9qEnm
PORT=3000
```

## Step 4: Update package.json for Railway

Railway will automatically run `npm start`. Make sure your package.json has:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsx src/mcp-server.ts"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Get Your Server URL

After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
```
https://espen-d6-mcp-server-production.up.railway.app
```

## Step 6: Test Your Remote Server

Visit your URL to confirm it's working:
```
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "espen-d6-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Step 7: Add to Claude.ai

1. Go to [claude.ai/settings/integrations](https://claude.ai/settings/integrations)
2. Click "Add custom integration"
3. Enter your Railway URL: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app`
4. Click "Add"
5. Enable the tools you want to use

## Alternative: Render.com

If Railway doesn't work, try [render.com](https://render.com):

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Set build command: `npm install`
4. Set start command: `tsx src/mcp-server.ts`
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy

## Alternative: Vercel

For Vercel deployment:

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in your project directory
3. Follow the prompts
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Port Issues:**
- Make sure your server listens on `process.env.PORT`
- Railway automatically assigns the PORT environment variable

**Environment Variables:**
- Double-check all D6 credentials are set correctly
- Use Railway dashboard to verify variables

**Build Failures:**
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify HTTPS (required for Claude.ai)
- Test health endpoint first
- Check Railway service logs

## âœ… Success Indicators

1. âœ… Railway deployment succeeds
2. âœ… Health endpoint returns 200 OK
3. âœ… Environment variables loaded correctly
4. âœ… D6 API connection works
5. âœ… Claude.ai can connect to your server

## ðŸ“§ Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Test the health endpoint
3. Verify environment variables
4. Check D6 API connectivity

**Railway is free for basic usage and perfect for MCP servers!**
