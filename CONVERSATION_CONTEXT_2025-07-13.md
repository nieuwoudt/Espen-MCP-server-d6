## 🏢 **Enterprise Integration Requirements (Discussed)**

### **Two Espen Modes:**
1. **Standard Mode:** Manual signup, manual subject selection, no school integration
2. **Enterprise Mode:** Full D6 integration, automated onboarding, role-based MCP context

### **Enterprise Features Needed:**
- **Automated Onboarding:** Pre-onboard all school stakeholders from D6 data
- **Role-Based Access:** Hierarchical permissions with school-level isolation
- **Parent Notifications:** SMS/email alerts with login credentials
- **Personalized Context:** MCP data tailored to user roles

### **Permission Structure:**
```
Principal/Executive → School-wide access to all MCP data
HOD → Department-specific data and teacher analytics  
Teachers → Only assigned classes + student data + parent contacts
Students → Personal data only, no visibility of others
```

### **D6 API Integration Strategy:**
- **Primary Endpoints:** `/schools/{id}/learners`, `/schools/{id}/staff`, `/schools/{id}/parents`
- **Real-time Sync:** Webhooks for enrollment changes
- **Bulk Import:** Automated school onboarding
- **Role Mapping:** D6 roles to Espen permission levels

## 📋 **Comprehensive Jira Ticket Created**

### **Title:** "Enterprise D6 Integration: Automated School Onboarding with Role-Based MCP Access"
### **Story Points:** 21 (High Priority)

#### **Three Development Phases:**
1. **Phase 1: D6 API Integration Setup** (5 points)
   - Extend D6 service for enterprise endpoints
   - Create role mapping layer
   - Build bulk import scripts
   - Implement webhook handlers

2. **Phase 2: Role-Based MCP Context** (8 points)
   - Permission engine with hierarchical access
   - MCP context router with role filtering
   - School-level data isolation
   - Context caching for performance

3. **Phase 3: Automated Onboarding & Notifications** (8 points)
   - User provisioning from D6 data
   - Credential generation and distribution
   - SMS/email notification system
   - Parent engagement workflows

#### **Technical Architecture:**
- Multi-tenant JWT with role claims
- Row-level security (RLS) policies
- Hybrid sync strategy (real-time + batch)
- Parent notification service with templates

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Role Mapping Strategy:**
```typescript
interface RoleMapping {
  d6Role: 'Learner' | 'Teacher' | 'HOD' | 'Principal';
  espenRole: 'student' | 'teacher' | 'hod' | 'principal';
  permissions: string[];
  mcpDataAccess: string[];
}
```

### **Security Architecture:**
- School-level tenant isolation
- JWT with role-based claims
- Supabase RLS policies
- MCP context filtering by role

### **Data Synchronization:**
- **Real-time:** Enrollment changes, staff updates (webhooks)
- **Daily:** Attendance, conduct, assignment scores (batch)
- **Weekly:** Full reconciliation and validation (cron)

### **Parent Communication:**
- SMS notifications via Twilio
- Email templates for different scenarios
- Automated credential distribution
- Multi-language support (English, Afrikaans, Zulu)

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **For Developer:**
1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Use existing configuration and environment variables
2. **Test MCP Connection** - Verify client can connect to deployed server
3. **Validate Educational Scripts** - Ensure all demo functionality works
4. **Review Enterprise Requirements** - Understand role-based access needs

### **For Enterprise Integration:**
1. **D6 API Credentials** - Obtain production access for target schools
2. **Supabase Setup** - Multi-tenant database configuration
3. **SMS/Email Services** - Integrate Twilio and email providers
4. **Webhook Configuration** - Set up real-time D6 change notifications
